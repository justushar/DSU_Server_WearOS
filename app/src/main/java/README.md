# WearOS DSU Motion Source (WIP)

The project aims to reverse engineer **MotionSource** by sshnuke, which was developed to utilize the **Cemuhook protocol** for gyroscope and accelerometer values to be used with emulators such as **Cemu**.

This application runs a **CemuHook (DSU) server** on your **Wear OS device**, allowing you to use its high-fidelity motion sensors for gyro aiming and other motion-controlled actions in your favorite games.

## Desired Features

- **High-Fidelity Motion Control**  
  Utilizes your watch's fused `GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR` sensor for stable, low-latency motion tracking.

- **Emulator Compatibility**  
  Fully compatible with any emulator that supports the CemuHook DSU client protocol, including **Cemu** and **Dolphin**.

- **Simple UI**  
  A clean, single-button interface designed for Wear OS. Just start the server and play.

- **Power Efficient**  
  Uses power and Wi-Fi locks to ensure a stable connection during gameplay without excessive battery drain.

- **Modern & Native**  
  A complete, native Android application built for modern Wear OS versions.

## Requirements

- A **Wear OS watch** (Wear OS 3 or newer recommended).
- A **PC** running an emulator (e.g., **Yuzu**, **Cemu**).
- Both your **watch** and your **PC** must be connected to the same **Wi-Fi network**.

## How It Works

- This application implements a **CemuHook server** that listens for **UDP packets on port 26760**.
- It uses a **subscribe-and-stream** model:
    - The server waits for a client (the emulator) to send a "data request" packet.
    - Upon receiving the first request, it registers the clientâ€™s IP address and starts a dedicated background thread.
    - This thread continuously streams motion data packets to the client at a high frequency.
- The server uses the `GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR` sensor to get a stable orientation. It calculates:
    - A **gravity vector** (sent as accelerometer data).
    - A **real-time rotation rate** (sent as gyroscope data).
- The sensor data is transformed from the watchâ€™s **portrait** coordinate system to the **landscape** system expected by a standard gamepad before being sent.
- If the server stops receiving **heartbeat** requests from the client for more than 5 seconds, it automatically stops the stream to save battery.
